# PROPHET

Prophet is an educational web trading application designed for newbies to trade on the financial markets. The application is geared towards teachers and students, where teachers can create a room with a particular set of companies for students to trade virtual money. On creation of the room a unique URL is generated which then teachers can send out to students to join the room automatically.

Inside the rooms, live stock market data is used to render and update the bar charts, candle charts, and ticker information in real time. Additionally, the platform provides news information and a sentiment analyzer which lets the students know if that article is neutral, positive or negative about that company. With all this information the students can make a informed buy or sell decision.
